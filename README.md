# Programming Assessment

To evaluate your mathematical modeling/simulation skills a bit more, we would like you to complete a short coding assignment.

## Assessment Task

Build an interactive simulation that demonstrates what happens to objects in freefall on planet Earth.

### Requirements

- Use Earth's gravity.
- Provide atmosphere options:
  - Air
  - No air (vacuum)
- Include UI elements to:
  - Start the simulation
  - Restart the simulation
  - Display elapsed time
  - Display velocity
- Graphics/animation can be basic/utilitarian â€” the math model/simulation code is the primary focus.
- **Bonus:** Include UI element(s) that display any or all of the following:
  - Force of gravity
  - Buoyancy
  - Drag

### Technical Details

- You may house the simulation in an `index.html` page.
- You are welcome to use any JavaScript libraries.
- Submit your response in either of the following ways:
  - As a zip file of the page
  - Hosted online (e.g., GitHub, CodePen)

Please submit your response before your interview.

## How to Run

Simply open the `Freefall.html` file in any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
All assets are loaded locally and no server setup is required.
